This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

Missing this part for React Native Track Player:

module.exports = async function() {

    // but it will be used later in the "Receiving Events" section
}
